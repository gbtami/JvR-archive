      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">The organisers of Salzburg 1942 intended to bring together world
      champion Alekhine, former champion Euwe, challenger Keres, former
      challenger Bogoljubow, Stoltz and German champion Schmidt,
      the six strongest players of Germany and the occupied countries. Euwe had
      declined the invitation for München 1941 due to his ‘occupational
      obligations’, as manager of a groceries business. This time he refused to
      participate, because Alekhine was invited. Euwe mentioned futile reasons.
      The real motive was Alekhine’s offence of Euwe in his anti-Semitic articles.
      Alekhine had written about the 'Jewish clique' around&nbsp; Euwe in 1935. The main
      organiser, Ehrhardt Post, wanted to exclude Alekhine, but the notorious
      name stayed on the list. Then, Euwe withdrew due to ‘illness’. His place
      was occupied by Junge. The tournament was originally planned for January
      1942, but it took place from 9-18 June 1942 eventually.</font> </p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">Chess events took place in the wonderful rooms of Mirabell Palace. The
      tournament hall was situated near Berchtesgaden, summer residence of
      Hitler. Play started at 9 AM. The players had to make 32 moves in two
      hours. Thereafter, the tempo became 16 moves per hour.</font></p>

      lineup of all participants, who greeted Hitler. Nevertheless, the Nazi
      tournaments were not an important propaganda vehicle.&nbsp; Duty at the front
      had become more important. Chess had been used for propaganda before the
      war.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">No wartime tournament book about Salzburg 1942 appeared. Only short
      reports were published in chess journals. Ken Whyld collected nineteen
      games from these sources. When Lothar Schmid loaned him the original
      scores, he could publish the notation of all thirty games in 1962. Lachaga
      published the games with previous annotations in 1974.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">Great fights occurred during the wartime tournament: only 27% of the
      games were drawn and the average game lasted more than 50 moves. Alekhine
      gained his best result during World War II, although his fighting spirit
      was more important than his positional ability. Keres played well, but
      became second after the ruling world champion, like he was second after
      the future champ Botvinnik in 1941. A great success had the
      eighteen-years-old Junge. He showed himself as equal to the grandmasters
      in all phases in the game. Schmidt played solid chess. Bogoljubow led after the first cycle, but
      lost all games of the second cycle. Stoltz had little success.</font></p>

      1943. The chess world did not forget his Nazi articles. He died in 1946
      under suspicious circumstances.
      <i>Paul Keres </i> travelled to Sweden in
      1944. After the war he returned to his wife and two children in Estonia. A
      letter to Molotov spared his life.<i> Klaus Junge’s</i> last tournament
      became Prague 1942. He shared the first prize with Alekhine. The next year
      he had to enlist the army. As an officer of the 12th
      SS-battalion, he joined the defence of Hamburg in April 1945. The First UK
      Royal Tank Regiment opposed the defenders on 18 April. A skirmish took
      place in Welle on the Lüneburger Heide. Lieutenant Junge got the chance
      to surrender, but believed in the final victory, shouted: &quot;Sieg
      Heil!&quot; and was shot to pieces. Germany had to wait until Hübner for
      a new great talent. The first Junge Memorial, Regensburg 1946, was won by
      Bohatirchuk.
      <i>Paul Schmidt </i> studied chemistry at
      Heidelberg after the war. He worked in the chemical industry of the USA. <i>Efim
      Bogoljubow </i> remained active in
      the German chess world. He died from a heart attack in 1952, when he came
      home from a simultaneous display. <i>Gösta Stoltz</i> returned to Sweden in
      1942. The chess world held no grudge against him and he was invited for
      Groningen 1946.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial"><i>Mirabell Palace</i> became a
      popular place for weddings. It served as a location for ‘The Sound of
      Music’. When Julie Andrews and the children descend the steps of the
      Mirabell Gardens, they sing: &quot;Do-Re-Mi!&quot;</font></p>
