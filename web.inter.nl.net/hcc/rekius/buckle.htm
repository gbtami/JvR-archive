      <i>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">Henry Thomas Buckle</font></i><font face="Arial"> was born in Lee
      near London on 2 November 1821 during a family visit. His health was frail
      and he developed slowly. As the son of a wealthy shipowner and merchant,
      he entered his father’s business in London. When the father died in
      1840, he left the trade and became independent with a large annual income.
      He regarded his historical research as work and playing chess as leisure.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">His family sent him on a Grand Tour to Belgium, Germany, Italy and
      France. He would make many long journeys in his life. Chess was played and
      languages were learned in various countries. In 1843 he played a short match against Staunton, who gave pawn and
      move (Buckle had White in each game and pawn f7 was removed). Buckle lost
      the first game and won the other six. He made no notation of his moves.
      Staunton published his win and one loss in his journal <i>The Chess Player’s
      Chronicle.&nbsp;</i></font></p>

      played many casual games against Captain Hugh Alexander Kennedy, an army
      officer who had become an author. Captain Kennedy wrote very favourable
      about Buckle’s play, and Staunton enthusiastically selected some of the
      games for his journal, but the level is disappointing from a present view.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">When Buckle travelled to Paris in 1848, he played a series of games
      against Kieseritzky (+3, -2, =3) in the Café de la Régence. The level of
      the games was still poor, e.g. Kieseritzky won a rook in game one, but
      overlooked mate in one.</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The breakthrough came in London 1849, when twelve players competed in a
      chess tournament among frequent visitors to the Cigar Divan at the Strand.
      The tournament began with two knockout rounds. Buckle defeated Smith in
      round one (+2) and Williams in round two (+2). He played innovative chess
      in round two. In the final of three players, Buckle defeated G.W. Medley
      (+1) and J.R. Medley (+1).&nbsp;</font></p>

      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">Buckle did not make time for participation in the international
      tournament London 1851. When it was finished, a series of matches for
      seven wins began. At his request, Buckle’s match versus Löwenthal was
      shortened to four wins. Buckle narrowly won (+4, -3, =1). After the match
      Buckle played casual games against Kieseritzky and Anderssen.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">The rising of Buckle and Anderssen marked the end of the Staunton era.
      Prophylactic play had started with Philidor and Staunton, but Buckle
      brought it on a modern level. He also had an acceptable tactical ability.
      Anderssen had crushed Staunton’s slow defensive play with dazzling
      attacks. Little happened in chess after 1851. A match between Anderssen and
      Buckle would have been a real treat in the time before Morphy’s stardom.&nbsp;</font></p>

      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">However, Buckle was not the popular mad genius who saw chess as the
      only goal of his life. He found the victory in a match a ‘frivolous
      triumph’, and hated the lack of time limitation in chess. &quot;The
      slowness of genius is hard to bear, but the slowness of mediocrity is
      intolerable&quot;, he remarked. Poor health gave him a short life. He
      devoted his remaining time to his book <i> ‘History of Civilisation’</i>.
      Occasionally, he visited the Divan.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">William Cluley published a theory of chess strategy in 1857. He
      considered a draw as the logical end of a game. Fortification is regarded
      as an important aim of development. An attack needs preparation. Lasker
      wrongly attributed this theory to Steinitz. Buckle’s play precedes Cluley’s concepts. The decisive game in the
      match against Löwenthal gives a fine example. Buckle has developed a
      solid position. The double fianchetto with White precedes a preference of
      Réti and Kramnik.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">Prophylactic play was fully developed at the beginning of the 1850's.
      At the end of the decade, fine tactics were added by Morphy, the first
      complete player.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">Buckle liked to read. His photographic memory allowed him te read a
      book once and evaluate it immediately. His library grew to 22,000 volumes.
      He could sell half, because he simply knew them. An encyclopaedic
      knowledge about history had been developed in his mind. He studied
      nineteen languages on his travels and spoke nine fluently.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">Basic ideas for the <i>‘History of Civilization’</i> were conceived
      in the 1840's. Although he devoted much time to this project, it took
      until 1857 til the first volume was published. Buckle wants to find laws
      of society beyond its peculiarities. For instance, he finds a relationship
      between prosperity and early marriages of men. Another find is the
      slightly higher number of boys than girls at birth, independent of
      society. A great aphorism is: &quot;Society prepares the crime, the
      criminal commits it&quot;. His search for the laws of civilization resembles the positivism of
      Comte. The Frenchman developed a reliable method for scientific research:
      facts form the basis of theory.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">Buckle’s lecture in 1858 was published as <i>‘The influence of
      Women on the Process of Knowledge’.</i> He advices a fine education of
      girls, because they instruct future generations. It is based on his own
      positive experience. When his mother Jane died in 1859, his health further
      deteriorated. Nevertheless, the second volume of <i>‘History of Civilization’</i>
      was published in 1861. The working title for the planned trilogy had
      become the modest <i>‘Introduction to the History of Civilization in
      Britain’</i>. His book about social evolution had a similar reception as
      Darwin’s <i>‘Origins of Species’</i> (1859) about the evolution of
      animals and mankind: much appreciation abroad and hatred in Britain. Many
      conclusions irritated the English arrogance.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">Buckle made a journey for mental rest to Egypt and Palestine. He
      contracted typhoid fever in Jerusalem and died in Damascus on 29 May 1862.
      His last words are supposed to be: &quot;My book, what about my
      book?&quot; The answer became <i>‘The Miscellaneous and Posthumous Works
      of Henry Thomas Buckle’</i> (1872).</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">In chess, Lasker, Botvinnik and Nunn are mentioned as scientists,
      although they never made an intellectual achievement of lasting value,
      like me. Buckle was a great chess player <i>and</i> scientist.</font></p>
