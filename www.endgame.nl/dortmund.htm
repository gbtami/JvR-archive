      manner. He defeated his main rival Réti with an opening that would be
      called the Sämisch Variation. His play under time pressure was praised!
      Bogoljubow only shared the fourth prize, because he played too optimistic
      against two lesser players. He would win the super tournament Bad
      Kissingen during the second half of August. Colle won the brilliancy prize
      for his game against Spielmann. The tournament was played in the early
      days of hyper modern chess. Indian openings were at an experimental stage:
      the Nimzo-Indian, Queen’s Indian and King’s Indian Defences were
      applied. Draws were rare: only 28%! The difference with later tournaments
      did not lie in lesser perception, but insufficient technics to draw an
      even position: more blunders were made.</font></p>

      won. Taimanov was victorious in Dortmund 1961. When the match Spassky - Fischer was planned, Dortmund
      competed for the organisation, but it became Reykjavik 1972. Enthusiasm
      remained and the second Open German was played in the <i>Westfalenpark</i> from
      17 May - 2 June 1973. Hecht, Andersson and Spassky shared the first place.&nbsp;</font></p>

      Immediately after this event, the <i>1. Internationale Dortmunder
      Schachtage</i> took place on the <i>Tanzinsel</i> of the Westfalenpark from 3 - 9 June. Westerinen won. The <i>Schachtage</i>
      became an annual event. An open tournament was added in1975. It became usual to organise several tournaments in
      one event, like in Dortmund 1928. The number of participants grew to
      hundreds.&nbsp;A tradition of Rheinland-Westfalen continued, because Dortmund
      is situated near
      Düsseldorf where the first<i> Schachbund</i> was founded in 1861.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="justify" style="word-spacing: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial"> The
      organisation of a super tournament had become easier, because the Eastern European players
could participate anywhere after the downfall
      of the Iron Curtain. World champion Kasparov and his rivals
      Ivanchuk, Bareev, Anand and Salov competed with the new talents Kamsky,
      Adams, Shirov and Piket, and senior Hübner. The promising youngsters Kramnik and Lékó took part in the Open
tournament.
      Many debutants would become regulars in Dortmund.&nbsp;</font></p>

    were astonishing. Nevertheless, the tournament became a race between
    Kasparov, Ivanchuk, Bareev and Salov. The last mentioned was eliminated in
    round eight. Three potential winners played with White in the last round.
    All got an advantage, but only Kasparov won. He catched up with Ivanchuk and became number

      semifinals and a final followed. Lékó won the final against Topalov
      by 2½–1½. in the Goldsaal of the Westfalenhalle. The challenger of
      Kramnik gained 100,000 Euro and the runner-up 70,000 Euro. Organisers were

      first group. All games in the second group were drawn! Kramnik and Lékó
      qualified before Bologan and Karjakin after six rounds of blitz. Two
      classical and two rapid games were drawn in both semifinals. Blitz led to
