      Famous games were played. Steinitz - Von Bardeleben became an evergreen

      young star.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial" size="3">The

      Pillsbury. He explained: &quot;I want to be quiet. I mean to win this
      tournament!&quot; The
      masters played in the Brassey Institute. Moves were regarded as
      the property of the tournament, but the reserve player Van Lennep could
      break this rule with his photographic memory. He wrote a long report in
      Dutch.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial" size="3">Lasker
      had defeated Steinitz in a world title match during the previous year.

      experience. Bird had even participated in London 1851. Important young
      talents were Pillsbury and Schlechter. Outsiders were Albin, Janowski,
      Marco, Mason, Mieses, Pollock Teichmann, Tinsley, Vergani and

      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><b>Monte Carlo </b>wanted
      to stimulate tourism during the winter. Four chess events were organised
      as stimulus. Fourteen
      participants played in the first master tournament from 1 ii
      until 1 iii <b>1901</b>. Prince Dadian of Mongrelia and Arnous de Rivière
      were the main organisers. The first round was postponed to 4 ii due to the
      funeral of Queen Victoria. When a game ended in a draw, each player got
      ¼. A player could score ½, ¼ or 0 in the replay with reversed colours.
      Poor Alapin had to repeat eight out of thirteen games. He complained
      bitterly. Janowsky won the first prize of 5000 Francs. 7300 Francs were
      shared by Schlechter, Von Scheve, Chigorin, Alapin and Mieses. The other
      players got consolation money. I have selected eight games.

      Teichmann, Schlechter and Tarrasch have been selected. Maróczy won the
      tournament and gained 5000 francs. The accuracy of his games is
      remarkable.&nbsp;The costs for
      the organisation were diminished by the gambling of players. Janowsky lost
      everything. The casino bank gave him a train ticket to Paris.&nbsp;</p>

      from St. Petersburg, he was not welcome, because he had doubted the
      authenticity of spectacular wins by Prince Dadian of Mingrelia. Chigorin
      got 1500 Francs as payoff. Alapin, Gunsberg and Janowsky got no
      invitations beforehand. Fourteen men played double rounds from 10 ii until 17
      iii 1903. When participants complained about the noise, the director
      Arnous de Rivière answered: &quot;You get used to it!&quot; Tarrasch
      started poorly but won the tournament. Maróczy became second, Pillsbury
      third, Schlechter fourth and Richard (Teichmann) the fifth. Moreau lost all twenty-six

      Marshall had a won position against Maróczy in the last round but lost. Maróczy won the tournament
      half-a-point before Schlechter. Marshall became third at one point. The
      casino made available 5000 Franks as prize. A
      distribution of the money was made by the participants, before they began.

    Three master events occurred in <b> Oostende </b>

    francs. We follow their race over twenty rounds.&nbsp;The tournament was meant to be a kind of world championship, but nobody
    took it seriously due to the absence of Lasker. The new term ‘grandmaster

    tournaments as an annual phenomenon started with Hastings 1895. Many of the
    events took place in towns on the seaside. The experience of great masters
    grew immensely until 1911. We will follow the developments by means of the
    common ideas about the schools of chess.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">A
    confrontation between the old and young masters occurred in Hastings 1895.
    The main representative of <i>romantic chess</i> was Chigorin. He played in
    the attacking style of De la Bourdonnais and Anderssen. Steinitz played <i>positional
    chess</i>. The ideas were developed by the theorist Cluley and applied by
    Morphy. Younger players like Tarrasch, Lasker and Pillsbury had digested the
    strategic basis and improved on the <i>technique </i>of chess. Nevertheless,
    many tactical and positional blunders were made in Hastings.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Maróczy
    developed a <i>routine</i> of correct chess. He showed a superiority in
    Monte Carlo 1902 by waiting for the mistakes of the opponent. Capablanca
    displayed the accuracy of a ‘chess machine’ in San Sebastian 1911. His
    technical level would not be improved by future players and the group of superior
    technicians has always remained small. Only the number of good quality
    players has increased enormously. A
    new inspiration came from the <i>prophylactic chess</i> by Nimzowitsch. He
    showed his innovative chess in 1911-12. Important predecessors were Philidor, Staunton and Paulsen.&nbsp;</font></p>
