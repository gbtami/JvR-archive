      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">One night I carried out a logistic
      regression on a sample of schoolchildren. Who started smoking from the age of 13 to
      15 was predicted with the
      accuracy of the roll of a die! Six factors (smoking by age peers, parental smoking, availability of tobacco, pocket money, self-efficacy and beliefs)
      were statistically significant predictors over two years but failed to classify
      new smokers accurately.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Dutch scientists have critical views
      on simplistic smoking mechanisms. My predecessor Gadourek refuted
      Freud's oral fixation, because he found no relationship between
      tobacco and candy consumption. He used bivariate analysis as a
      sharpshooter. I applied multivariate analysis as a machine gun on
      hypothetical
      mechanisms.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="logistic.jpg" width="641" height="287"></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The results were published in the
      proceedings of a world congress on 'Tobacco and Health' in 1995, since I had paid
      the conference fees. Common scientific reactions were unwillingness
      and plagiarism, because my findings hit at the basis of primary smoking
      prevention. Facts conflicted with vested interests of social
      psychologists.&nbsp;</font></p>
