<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">Once the royal game of chess was a courteous affair. Because it was a rare
possibility for contact between unmarried women and men, romantic notions
developed. An idealised version portrays the woman as the superior player. First
she beats the man in an encounter at the board. Then she consoles him by giving
him her favours. This idea returns in the movie ‘The Thomas Crown Affair’
centuries later. After Steve McQueen has been mated by Fay Dunaway, she gives
him a long kiss. Tartakower conceived a new opening on a ship. Drunken and naked
he entered the cabin of the Dutch women’s champion and spoke: &quot;Your
move!&quot;. Soft hands returned him to his own place.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> <font face="Arial"> No reliable information is available about the games of chess
by noble ladies and courtesans. Playing will have been fast, because thinking is not gallant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">When chess becomes popular in coffeehouses and clubs, the female player
disappears from the picture literally. Often women are not even allowed to be
present. Generally, they are excluded from matches and tournaments in the nineteenth
century. Excellent play is only known from Amalie Paulsen, the sister of Louis
and Wilfried. She never played an official game.&nbsp;</font></p>

      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="PAUL1.JPG" width="302" height="414"></p>
<p align="center">Amalie Paulsen (1831-1869)</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">A tournament among women is played at the occasion of Hastings 1895. Easy
criticism starts immediately.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">Vera Menchik easily wins the first world championship for women in London
1927. She is invited for the great tournament Karlsbad 1929. Hans Kmoch
announces to choose the occupation of a ballerina, if she scores more than three
points. He is just saved from this fate. Menchik loses of the outstanding
players usually. If she could have participated in the British championship for
men, she might have won.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">In 1968 Donner writes about the lack of intuition among female players.
Apparently he misses the fifth place of world champion Gaprindashvili in
Hastings 1964-65. She becomes the first female international grandmaster in
1978. Her successor Chiburdanidze and the Swedish Cramling also become feared
gentlemen killers.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The sisters’ Polgár start a new phase in women’s chess. They defeat many
experienced players at an early age. The great star is Judit. She becomes the
youngest grandmaster ever in 1991. For the first time a woman seriously competes
with the top players.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">Female players are a small minority in the chess world. Nevertheless, the
participation by talented young women has become ordinary. A beating by a woman
used to be terrible, even worse than the banging by a Belgian. Men prefer
Yoshitoshi's view. Slowly the
struggle versus a woman becomes familiar, but little Judit often has to
experience the superior male stare, if she is lost.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">Will a woman ever reach the first place?
Do women play so poorly, because they menstruate at the end of the game? A long list of views on women and
chess can be found in <i>Queen’s move</i> by Henriette Reerink. Only the
opinion of Maja Chiburdanidze makes a useful and unbiased impression. She
mentions the short history of female chess and the lesser physical stamina in a
long session.</font></p>
