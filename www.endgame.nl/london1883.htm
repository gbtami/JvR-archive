      participants were Zukertort, Steinitz, Blackburne, Chigorin, Englisch,
      Mackenzie, Mason, Rosenthal, Winawer, Bird, Noa, Sellmann, Mortimer and
      Skipworth. Seven prizes of £250, £150, £120, £90, £70, £50 and £25
      were available. The Löwenthal Consolation Prize of £50 was distributed
      among the losers, applying the Gelbfuhs system. Therefore, all players had
      some expenses covered.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Five games per
      week were played at the Victoria Hall in the Criterion from noon to 5 and
      7-11 PM. A time limit of 15 moves was regulated by connected stop-clocks.
      When one clock was stopped, the other started running, and visa-versa.
      This design by Thomas Bright Wilson (with advice from Blackburne) was used
      in a tournament for the first time. Draws had to be replayed on Wednesdays
      and Saturdays. Only the third draw counted as half-a-point.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">During the
      first cycle of the tournament, the players got a holiday for the Derby.
      That day platforms for visitors were erected at the Victoria Hall. As a
      result, one-hundred spectators could follow the game Steinitz-Zukertort
      during the second cycle. The tournament would last from 26 iv until 23 vi
      1883.&nbsp;</font></p>

      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Zukertort
      played an incredible tournament during twenty-three rounds. He scored
      twenty-two wins and one unlucky loss. Thereafter, he released the strain
      with opiates and lost the last three games. His dynamic style precedes
      Alekhine and Kasparov. He knows how to exert pressure on the opponent, his
      positional play is solid but not brilliant, and the combinations are
      exceptional. The famous win against Blackburne opens quietly, tension
      grows in the centre and the firework explodes suddenly.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Steinitz
      applied his uneven style. He took great risks against the strongest
      players and lost several games. Lesser players were met with his famous
      positional approach, and Steinitz crushed them with 17/20.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Blackburne
      played more cautiously than usual and scored many points with this approach.
      Chigorin knew how to exploit the weaknesses of Steinitz.</font></p>

      shared the fifth and sixth prize with Englisch and Mackenzie. The many
      repetitions of draws were unfavourable for Rosenthal. He made 26 valid
      scores in 45 rounds during the 59 days. A pleasant consolation was the
      brilliancy prize for a replay game with Black against Steinitz.</font></p>

      1899 was the fourth super chess tournament among Hastings 1895, Nürnberg
      1896, Wien 1898 and Paris 1900. All important players were invited.
      Refusals came from Tarrasch who worked as a medical doctor and
      Charousek who suffered from a fatal illness. The businessman Burn had to
      withdraw at the opening’s day. Fifteen participants played double rounds
      from 30 v until 10 vii 1899, except for Teichmann. He had to withdraw
      after his encounters with Pillsbury, Blackburne, Chigorin and Tinsley due
      to an eye disease. His remaining games in the first cycle were declared as
      lost.&nbsp;</font></p>

      were played in St Stephen’s Hall, near the Westminster Aquarium and
      Houses of Parliament. Seven tables, players and kibitzers seemed small in
      the gray hall. Statues of statesmen overshadowed them. The time limit was
      fifteen moves in one hour. Participants were entertained by the City of
      London chess club at Crystal Palace and the Star and Garter Hotel in
      Richmond, a favourite place of Dickens. A banquet took place in the
      International Hall of the Café Monico on 29 vi.&nbsp;</font></p>

      double round tournament had a remarkable start. Janowsky won four games

      when the world champion defeated the leader. Thereafter it became a Lasker
      show. He ended 4½ points before the candidates Janowsky, Maróczy and
      Pillsbury after thirty rounds. The runner-up Schlechter became fifth. The
      world champion had increased his superiority over the candidates since
      Nürnberg 1896. Strong players like Marshall, Marco and Mieses had to play
      in the single round tournament. Marshall won. An amount of £1020 for
      prizes and consolation money was distributed on 11 vii 1899. Lasker got
      £250 and a gold medal. Steinitz won no prize for the first time in his
