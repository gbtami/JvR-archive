      mini matches were played in the sixteenth Interpolis tournament <b>Tilburg
      1992</b>. 111 participants were involved. 94 started in round one. 17
      players were added later. So 64 competitors started in round two. Four
      players were left in round six. They had to play two games of classical
      chess in two days. The tempo was forty moves in two hours and the rest in
      one hour. If the outcome stayed undecided, rapid chess had to be played on
      day three. Gelfand and Adams qualified for the final. Adams won the
      tournament and received the grand prize of ƒ 100,000.&nbsp;</font></p>

    1993</b>. was another knockout event. Arbiter Gijssen had improved the time
    rule for rapid chess. The players got twenty minutes at the start of the
    game plus ten seconds per move. So time scrambles were avoided. The final
    became Karpov - Ivanchuk. Tolya was victorious in Tilburg for the seventh
    time and got the grand prize.&nbsp;</font></p>

      final against Bareev with 1½-½. The last Interpolis chess event had ended.&nbsp;<br>
      My analyses of endings started in the first half of the1990's. I had the chance to talk with Karpov in 1993 and Salov in 1994 about chess research. When I informed Karpov about criticism on my work, he responded: "I know study composers as fine analysts". A lot has changed since that time. Nowadays complete games can be analysed at a high level with the aid of modern chess engines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
