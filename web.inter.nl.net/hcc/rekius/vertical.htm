      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Yoshitoshi
      designed wonderful vertical diptychs during the second half of the 1880's.
      These prints are regarded as separate works of art. Odd stories
      are shown on puzzling pictures. I have acquired the eight most realistic
      images for Western eyes.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Yoshitoshi
      was at the height of his creative powers, when he conceived these prints.
      People regarded him as the number one in ukiyo-e. Many apprentices assisted him.
      A publisher organised the different stages. Carvers cut blocks for each
      colour. Printers produced the vertical diptych or kakemono (double oban or 9 x 28 inches). The
      days of first
      publication were events after the long preparations.&nbsp;</font></p>

      picture and a description unfold. A 'slide show' of individual prints
      begins, if ‘next print’ is clicked.&nbsp;</font></p>
