      van ‘t Kruijs was born in Uithoorn on 18 February 1813. His father was a
      trader in turf. Maarten moved to
      Amsterdam at a young age and worked as an organist. </font><font face="Arial">He
      had learned chess in his place of birth and stayed fascinated by the game.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Amsterdam
      1851 was his first recorded tournament. He defeated Heijmans in the final.
      Seven of his games were presented in the tournament book. The knockout
      tournament was played in the Leesmuseum at the Rokin.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Amsterdam
      1852 had a special content. Baron van der Hoeven, a nephew of Graaf van
      Zuylen van Nyevelt, applied an idea of his uncle. The position of the
      pieces in the initial position was resolved by chance. Fischer would call
      this game ‘random chess’. Seven players from <i>Philidor</i> and the
      Baron played an all-play-all tournament. Draws were replayed. Coopman,
      Heijmans, Van der Hoeven and Van ‘t Kruijs scored well. Maarten won the
      event, when he defeated Heijmans. He got a Chinese chess board and
      pieces.&nbsp;</font></p>

      great event was the visit of Anderssen to Amsterdam from 12 until 17 July
      1861. When Adolf arrived in an open carriage, the Dutch flag waved on the<i>
      Beurs van Zocher</i> at the Damrak. He was welcomed by the club ASG with a
      great diner. Anderssen would play twenty-six games during his visit and
      score nineteen wins, two draws and five losses. His games with Van ‘t
      Kruijs were the highlight. Although Anderssen scored five wins, two draws
      and one loss, he regarded his opponent as one of the ten best rivals in
      his career. Van ‘t Kruijs won the first game. Maarten was no match for
      Anderssen in short tactical games, but he scored a draw in a closed
      position. The seventh game also ended in a draw on the last day. Van ‘t
      Kruijs had a won position but repeated the moves. Anderssen spoke praising
      words and could catch a train in time. The gentleman Van ‘t
      Kruijs was a merchant during those days.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">He
      won Amsterdam 1878. His seven games were published in the <i>Jaarboekje.</i>
      He played with Bird in 1880 and defeated Loman in his last game. </font><font face="Arial">Van
      ‘t Kruijs has been described as a sturdy man in appearance and chess
      style. He pushed his mighty pawns forwards with a firm patience. Many
      opponents were crushed by connected passed pawns. </font><font face="Arial">He
      died in Amsterdam on 30 March 1885. </font></p>
