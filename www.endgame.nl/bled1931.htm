      Tarrasch made a great effort to organise the first important German chess
      tournament after the Great War. The best players took part, except for the
      top two, Capablanca and Lasker. Their additional financial demands were
      not accepted. The tournament was played in the Kurhaus of Baden-Baden from
      15 iv until 20 v 1925. A super tournament had been played at the same
      place in 1870.</font></p>

      draws. Rubinstein could not keep up in the race and scored 1½ points
      less. Sämisch became third and Bogoljubow fourth.&nbsp;</font></p>

      with world champion Alekhine. Euwe and Sultan Khan had other obligations.
      Rubinstein reacted too confused at the request. Fourteen important chess
      players accepted the invitation.&nbsp;</font></p>

      remained perfect until the last round on September 28. The tempo was 35
      moves in two hours, followed by 15 in one. Alekhine had shown a complete superiority
