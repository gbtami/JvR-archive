      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00"><b>Carel Mann</b> (1871-1928) was
      born in Amsterdam, as the son
      of a butcher. He got his own butcher’s shop in Haarlem at the beginning of the
      twentieth century. According to an anecdote, he used to compose with meat
      balls on the black and white tiles of his shop. A small inheritance of his
      mother allowed him to stop his trade and live the life of a poor tramp. He became mentally
      ill, suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. His illusion was a vampire,
      who sucked his red blood cells at night. At daytime the vampire had the
      image of a human being. Mann ‘recognised’ his enemy on the boat from
      Marseilles to Algiers and fired a revolver. Fortunately he missed. He was
      sentenced to receive mental treatment, and went to an institution in
      Ermelo. Patients were locked up inside. Outside they were chained.
      When he moved to Geel, his treatment became more humane. After his flight,
      no measures were taken. He started to compose endgame studies in Amsterdam. King chases became the main theme.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">Mann’s obsession with king chases
      could have been based on paranoia. In the Freudian version, the naughty
      black man(n) is chased by the white queen and her helper to every corner
      of the board. Counter-play is hardly possible. On the forced way to the
      fatal end, an occasional quiet move underlines fate. However, fear of
      women was not his obsession. Some paranoia is usual for a chess player,
      because of the illusion that the opponent wants to hurt you. Mann
      illustrated the paranoia of chess.</font></p>
