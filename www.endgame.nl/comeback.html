					<span class="style8">An international was organized at the 
					75-years Jubilee of the chess club Staunton in Groningen. It 
					was a difficult enterprise after World War II. Only Keres, 
					Fine and Reshevsky were missing from the elite. Nineteen 
					rounds were played from 13 viii until 7 ix 1946. The final 
					standings became: Botvinnik 14½/19 (f1500), Euwe 14 (f1250), 
					Smyslov 12½, Najdorf and Szabo 11½, Boleslavsky and Flohr 
					11, Lundin and Stoltz 10½, Denker, Kotov and Tartakower 9½, 
					Kottnauer 9, Yanofsky 8½, Bernstein and Guimard 7, Vidmar 
					6½, Steiner 6, O´Kelly 5½, Christoffel 5. Botvinnik had won 
					the event. Euwe was the only one who had given him a stiff 
					competition. Max had become a professional chess player 
					during the event. </span>

					<p class="style14"><span class="style8">Euwe remained 
					successful for half-a-year. He won the small tournaments 
					Amsterdam 1946 and Leiden 1946. Max crushed Grob in the 
					match Zürich, February 1947. <br />
					Mar del Plata 1947 was played in March. He began the 
					tournament by a win against Najdorf and scored 5 points in 6 
					rounds. The turning point happened in the game versus Julio 
					Bolbochan. Euwe also lost in the hands of the outsider 
					Hounie Fleurquin during the next round and did not compete 
					for the first place anymore. <br />
					Max had changed from a world-class player to an average 
					grandmaster. Causes were an overdose of chess and the effect 
					of aging. Euwe failed in the world championship of 1948. 
					Botvinnik had no competition and win the tournament of 
					his life. </span>
