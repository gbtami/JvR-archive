      <p align="justify"><font FACE="Arial">Landscapes are shown in a realistic
      way on Japanese woodblocks. Nature is shown beautifully but without
      sentimentality. Large landscape prints have been selected for an
      exhibition in the Stadshal of the Centre Céramique, Avenue Céramique 50
      in Maastricht from 25 June until 26 August 2006. </font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font FACE="Arial"><i>The Great Wave</i> by Hokusai is
      the most famous Japanese print, an icon. An enormous surfer’s wave breaks
      down on little men in rapid boats. A frightening grip seems to reach
      towards the men, but the flood
      lacks the gigantic volume of a tsunami. The event occurs in the narrow of
      Tokyo Bay. Mount Fuji can be seen in the middle. The print is an authentic
      reproduction, because the printing blocks have been recut after the
      original. A remarkable feature is the doubled size.&nbsp;</font></p>

      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">Dutchmen were
      the only foreigners who were allowed to visit Japan for centuries. They
      gave illustrated books about Dutch landscape art to the Shogun. This way
      Western art could have a deep influence on Hokusai and Hiroshige.</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">When American
      gunboats opened Japan during the 1850's, woodblocks became freely
      available. This way Japanese woodcuts could become fashionable and gain a
      strong effect on Western art. The impact on the impressionists is best
      known. Van Gogh wished to become as good as Hiroshige!</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">When Western
      art moved away from realistic landscapes, the <i>Shin Hanga</i> movement
      returned to traditional woodblock art in Japan during the twentieth
      century. Kawase Hasui was a main representative. His image of a village in
      front of Mount Fuji is shown above. The trees in the snow seem to be
      painted. Black lines have become less prominent on the prints than in the previous
      century. The size is double oban or 34 x 47 cm.&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="justify">When living beings appear on the prints, stories can be

      well-known tales about battles, demons and ghosts. Eight rare diptychs are
      shown on the exhibition.</p>

      Actually, the troops have landed near Wei-Hai-Wei during the Sino-Japanese
      war. Later Chinese ships will be destroyed in the nearby harbor.&nbsp;</p>

      artist from French descend. He depicted the beautiful bodies of a
      Polynesian chief and his slave. Critics wondered if the servant was a sex
      slave. A scandal was born, but the print remained allowed.&nbsp;</font></p>
