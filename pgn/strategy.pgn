{Advanced strategy in the endgame by Jan van Reek.  Lesson 1: An attack in the
centre.   Strategy in the endgame can be simple. I consider a usual situation.
One player seeks the struggle by moving the pieces forwards and another person
reacts to the attack. Such uncomplicated strategies of struggle will be
treated in several lessons. Difficult strategies will be discussed later. An
attack in the centre is a very simple strategy. The successful advance of
centre pawns has been shown by Philidor.   This example is more recent. Black
has a broad pawn centre. He can start a direct attack, if he advances the
pawns properly and uses the pieces for support.} 18... e5 19. Nb3 Nxb3+ 20.

{Lesson two: The attack on the king.   The final aim of the attacker is to
mate the opponent. Nevertheless a mating attack rarely occurs in the practical
endgame, because an experienced player will resign before it can happen. The

possibilities from the opponent. Blockade, the simplest prophylaxis, will be

blockader restricts the hostile mobility (Nimzowitsch). The example shows the

{Lesson eleven. Strong and weak squares.  A square in or close to the own
position is strong if it can be controlled and possibly occupied (a definition
after Euwe and Reti). It is irrelevant if the square is occupied or empty. If
a square is controlled by a pawn, the opponent cannot control it (Euwe in
Tijdschrift 1929). Therefore we consider the pawn structure as essential when
we search for strong squares.  At the start of the next endgame, the squares
b3, b2, d3 and f4 are strong for Black. The square d5 is strong for White. The
squares b5, e5 and g6 are not strong for White, because it is hardly possible
to control them. So White has four strong square and White one.} 45... Nd3 $6 (

{A chess position can be described in terms of matter, space and time (wood
stands on the board at a move). If you want to achieve something, you have to
devise a pocket strategy. If you give matter in order to win time, a
development sacrifice is made in the opening. It often happens to be a
breakthrough in the endgame.   Lesson seventeen. The breakthrough by pawns. A
breakthrough is essential in warfare. After trenches had been dug in World War
I, an advance became impossible. An opening emerged, when tanks were used in
Cambrai. Tanks and infantry moved forward. However, the hole was too small for
the cavalry to reach the green fields beyond. A similar case developed in
piece time. Pillsbury had to win in the last round of a legendary British
tournament. Little happened in the game. Suddenly he got an opportunity. The
black pawn structure seems secure, but Harry scores by a breakthrough. A
famous combination begins.} 27. f5 $1 g5 ({Lasker analyses} 27... gxf5 28. gxf5

{Lesson nineteen. The positional manoeuvre. If a player sacrifices time in
order to improve the own position or weaken the opponent, I call it a
prophylactic or positional manoeuvre. This manoeuvre occurred in an old match
of Edinburgh and London which started in 1824. The moves were sent weekly per
postal coach. A cup of 25 Guineas was the prize. The Scotch Gambit Cup still
exists. Three years after the start, the decisive phase in the fifth and last
game had been reached. Both cities play for mate. Black has progressed best.
Therefore, White has to give two moves in order to strengthen the own position.
