      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">The
      popularity of chess in Russia was revived by the government of the Soviet
      Union during the 1920's. Although Efim Bogoljubow lived in the German
      Triberg, he could become Soviet champion in 1925. The need of
      international competition was felt. Therefore, Krylenko organised a super
      tournament in Moscow from 10 xi - 7 xii 1925. Ten foreign stars, ten Soviet players and Bogoljubow participated.
      World champion Capablanca and his predecessor Lasker were lured to Moscow by gold. A race between them, like in New York 1924, was expected before the tournament, but Bogoljubow scored
      superiorly. Lasker and Capablanca followed at a distance. The other foreign stars competed at an equal level with the best Soviet players. Bogoljubow's win was regarded as a Soviet victory.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">The event aroused great interest among the citizens. Hundreds of spectators followed the games in Hotel Metropol and ten thousands watched demonstration boards downtown.
      Pictures of the event can be seen in the silent movie <i>Chess Fever</i>. Efim would never play in an important Russian tournament again. He became a German citizen.
      Later Bogoljubow and Alekhine were called 'renegades'.&nbsp;

	  The event was played in Moscow from 26 ix until 25 x 1927.
      Sixteen-years-old Botvinnik made his debut among the twenty-one players.
      The youth played well in the Hall of Columns, but the real battle went
      between the radiologist <b> Bohatirchuk</b> and bank worker <b>Romanovsky</b>.
      Romanovsky led by one point, when the penultimate round began. He lost to
      Grigoriev and Bohatirchuk caught up. The leaders played draws in the final
      round. They shared the first place with 14½/21, followed by

      A match for the championship did not take place, because Bohatirchuk had

      analysed the games by these two senior players. </font><font FACE="Arial">Leningrad
      1934 started as a race between Bohatirchuk and Alatortsev. Later Fedor
      gained a lead of one point on the other players, but he finished poorly. At

      devoted his life to cancer research as a radiologist in Kiev. Chess was
      his hobby. He wanted to play only one tournament per year. The Stalinists
      objected. Fedor survived an interrogation in 1937. Many Ukrainians greeted
      the Nazis as liberators in 1941, but got a bad treatment instead.
      Bohatirchuk joined a German research institute. His family fled when the
      Russians returned. Fedor endorsed the naive Prague Manifesto in 1944. The
      main subject was freedom and democracy after Stalin. Maybe he was the only
      signer who was not executed by the Stalinists. Fedor defeated Czech chess
      maters in a simultaneous session during his visit. Pachman wrote a booklet
      about it. Although their train was bombed when they fled, his family managed to reach
      Bayreuth in the American section of Germany by foot. Eventually he moved
      to his daughter in Canada and became Professor of Radiology in Ottawa. </font></p>

      eighteenth championship took place in Moscow from 10 November until 12
      December 1950. It was dedicated to the hundredth birthday of Chigorin.
      Keres, Smyslov and Boleslavsky had accepted the invitation to participate.
      Fifteen players qualified in the semifinals: Tolush, Alatortsev and
      Bondarevsky in Leningrad, Aronin, Petrosian and Liublinsky in Kharkov,
      Lipnitsky, Geller and Sokolsky in Kiev, Averbakh, Borisenko and Suetin in
      Tula and Konstantinopolsky, Flohr and Mikenas in Tartu. I have analysed
      the games of the winner Keres and runner-up Tolush. Alexander Tolush was
      an adventurous attacker with mixed results. Once a fan shouted:
      &quot;Forwards Kasimirovich!&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">Dominating
      players in Moscow 1950 were Aronin, Lipnitsky and Smyslov at first. Keres
      and Tolush scored well in the second half. Paul made a sprint of 6½/7 but
      Alexander could catch up before the last round. The ferocious attacker
      Tolush got a winning position against Boleslavsky in the final round but
      blundered and had to accept a draw after the adjournment. Keres had a
      better endgame against Averbakh, won after the resumption and became the
      champion. </font></p>
