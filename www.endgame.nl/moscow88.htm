      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">The
      55<sup>th</sup> Soviet championship was played in Moscow from 25 July - 18
      August 1988. All chess stars participated for the first time since 1973.
      It would become the last great Soviet championship.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Eighteen
      players took part. Beliavsky, Salov and Ehlvest qualified as the top three
      of the previous championship. Seven players were invited: world champion
      Kasparov, former world champions Karpov, Smyslov and Tal, and the
      candidates Yusupov and Sokolov.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Eight
      places were at stake in two preliminary rounds in 1987. Two Swiss
      tournaments were played at Norilsk and Pavlodar as qualification for two
      sections of the First League. Thereafter, Ivanchuk, Yudasin, Gavrikov and
      Gurevich qualified in Lvov. Furthermore, Smirin, Khalifman, Kharitonov and
      Malaniuk were the best in Sverdlovsk. Reserves became Eingorn, Chernin,
      Tseshkovsky, Gelfand and Novikov. </font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">The
      Super League was played in Moscow’s new International Hotel.
      One-thousand seats were available for the audience in the playing hall.
      Mikhail Botvinnik functioned as senior arbiter. Tal drew against Vaganian
      in the first round. Yusupov was asked to play the second round in a hotel
      room due to Tal’s illness. Artur refused. The arbiters decided to
      replace Tal by Eingorn.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Why
      the 55<sup>th</sup> championship was so important, is not discussed in the
      sources, but I can reconstruct three factors:</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">1.
      The strongly increased prizes of the Super League made participation
      interesting for the stars.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">2.
      A large group of young talents had entered the scene in recent years.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">3.
      All players hoped to star and receive invitations by foreign tournaments.
      The acceptation had become easier, and Soviet players were allowed to keep
      half of the prize money. Especially, the GMA tournaments were financially
      attractive.</font></p>

      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Many
      dull games were played in Moscow 1988. The ability to draw was the
      greatest progress in the Soviet championship: 36% of the games were drawn
      in Leningrad 1934, 47% in Moscow 1957 and 66% in Moscow 1988.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Kasparov
      and Karpov shared the first place with +6, =11. Beliavsky played the most
      interesting chess, shared the lead in the rounds 7 and 8, but ended with a
      level score. Salov fought hard in long games, despite his prophylactic
      style. Defeats against Kasparov and Yusupov made him descend to the fourth
      place. Yusupov lost against Karpov and Ivanchuk. A strong finish gained
      him the bronze medal. Eingorn as replacement and Ivanchuk as debutant did
      well. Yudasin became seventh, a fine result for someone who had to play
      two qualification tournaments in 1987. Smyslov started poorly but finished
      good.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">High
      places in the tournament were taken by the collectors of advantages:
      Karpov, Yusupov and Salov. Kasparov claimed to be a dynamic player.
      Therefore, I searched for games with the finest characteristic of
      dynamism: giving material for time. The greatest example was played by ...
      Karpov against Yusupov. A careful collection of advantages in the endgame
      was made by ... Kasparov against Salov. The claim by Kasparov resulted
      from his arrogance. Adventurous times of Tal and Spassky were gone.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Normally
      a match of four games would have followed, because two players shared the
      first place. E.g. Beliavsky had defeated Salov with 3-1 shortly after the
      previous championship tournament. The two K’s started difficulties. A
      match was not played, despite the efforts of Botvinnik among others. Both
      players got a gold medal in December 1988. </font><font face="Arial">The
      following political developments were far more important. The Berlin wall
      fell in November 1989. A communist putsch against Gorbachov failed in
      1991. When Jeltsin overtook power, the Soviet-Union ceased to exist.
      Therefore, the last Soviet chess championship was played in 1991.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Years
      before the collapse of the Soviet regime, cracks in the system became
      apparent. The world championship in 1997 was not played in the
      Soviet-Union but in Seville. The tournament book of Moscow 1988 was
      published in Russian and English as <i>Chess in USSR, Soviet Tournament
      News Review 1.</i> It was printed in Rome! </font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Soviet
      players got more liberty to participate in foreign tournaments. They were
      also allowed to keep a part of the prize money. </font><font face="Arial">When
      the restrictions ended in 1991, they flooded the Western tournaments.
      Twenty of the thirty-six best players of the world were former Soviet
      citizens. They dominated most super tournaments.</font></p>
