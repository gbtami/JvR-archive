      of thirty-six ghosts</font></b></p>
      <p align="right"><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#FF0000">by Taiso
      Yoshitoshi</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Ghosts
      stories were popular in Japan. People liked to gather by candlelight and
      tell scary tales. When a legend was finished, one candle was blown out and
      the next person began.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">When
      Yoshitoshi created <i>100 ghosts’ stories,</i> he used this tradition.
      Twenty-six selected designs and a title page were published in 1865. It
      became his first popular series.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">Two
      decades later he told and retold stories. <i>New
      forms of 36
      ghosts</i> were Yoshitoshi’s last important series. </font><font face="Arial">The
      woodblocks were made after Japanese and Chinese stories. Many pupils assisted
      him during the complicated preparation. Circa twelve blocks were carved
      per design and separately used for each colour or special effect. </font><font face="Arial"> The prints were
      published from 1889 until 1892. Three designs appeared posthumously.&nbsp;First
      editions sold out immediately, because Yoshitoshi
      had become a famous artist at the end of his life.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">The
      woodblocks are difficult to understand for Westerners. Therefore, I
      wrote direct descriptions in simple wordings. I hope that you will
      appreciate what you see. More information about the
      ghost stories can be found in a recent book by John Stevenson, <i>Yoshitoshi's
      Strange
      Tales, </i>Amsterdam 2005.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">The prints are
      listed in the order used by Segi and Keyes.&nbsp;When a thumbnail is
      clicked, a new page will be opened. The title, a large picture and a
      description unfold. A 'slide show' of individual prints begins, if ‘next
      print’ is clicked.&nbsp;</font></p>
