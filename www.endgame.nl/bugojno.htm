      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#000000">Bugojno was a sleepy Bosnian
      town in
      the quiet Yugoslavia of Marshall Tito. Great chess was played from 26 ii until 16 iii 1978.
      Main player was world champion Karpov. A series of five biannual events
      had started. One game per round plus an extra game have been selected for each tournament.&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"> Principal sponsor 'Slavko Radic' produced typewriters and
      metal parts. Chess gave prestige to Bugojno. Television devoted half-an-hour per
      day to the event. </font><font face="Arial">Although
      Karpov and Spassky had each lost one game, they led at the end of the
      penultimate round. They triumphed in their last game and scored 10/15
      (each won $2500), one point before Timman ($1500). </font></p>

      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">The
      second Bugojno super tournament lasted from 3 until 24 v 1980. Tito’s
      death on 4 v, a day after the first round, caused an interruption. The
      twelve participants were driven to Dubrovnik for
      a holiday. Gligoric went to the funeral in Belgrade. Round two was played
      after one week of national mourning.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;Karpov
      won in his old-fashioned shitty way&quot;, Timman wrote full of envy about
      the last round. Karpov won the tournament by 8/11. Larsen had scored 7½ and Timman 6½ points.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <hr>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">The third
      event was played in May 1982. Gary Kasparov was the young star.
      He triumphed in a grand style by 9½/13, 1½ points before Polugaevsky and Ljubojevic, and 2 points before Spassky and Hübner.&nbsp;</font></p>

      Bjelica acted strangely in their places. Timm</font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">an walked on

      tournament lasted from 25 v until 14 vi 1986. When Hübner heard about the
      starting fees and prizes on the phone, he demanded a written document.
      Bjelica invited Portisch instead. Lajos came and enjoyed a paid tennis
      vacation with Boris on the court near Hotel Akvarium. But the holy goal of
      a category 16 tournament had been achieved. Eight grandmasters played
      double rounds.&nbsp;Karpov won the tournament by 8½/14. Sokolov and
      Ljubojevic followed by one point. 70% of the games was drawn.&nbsp;</font></p>

      <font face="Arial">The organisers had great plans for an event in 1988,
      but nothing happened. Even a tournament book for 1986 was not published.
      When Yvette Nagel complained about the extreme dullness of Bugojno, she
      did not have the coming events in mind at all. The preparation of
      hostilities began in 1986. Verbal animosities raged from 1988 until 1991.
      Outright warfare occurred near Bugojno from 1993 until 1995. The battle
      for the strategic Donji Vakuf affected the northern side of Bugojno.
      Bosnia was divided by the
      Dayton agreement.</font>

      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">When
      Maarten de Zeeuw visited Bugojno in 1996, he found a largely destroyed
      Hotel Akvarium. Only the large Rook had survived the war (this monument
      celebrated the 1978 event). All organisers had left, because they were
      Serbians.&nbsp;</font></p>
