      Spanish city of Linares lies in Andalusia on the crossing of railroads to
      Madrid in the North, Granada in the South and Sevilla in the West. Metal
      mining was its main activity. Linares lead had an unsurpassed
      quality. Industry became a main activity.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="word-spacing: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">A
      dull existence changed when a series of tournaments started in 1978. The
      first <i>Ciudad de Linares</i> was a master tournament. We find the
      name of the Swedish master Jaan Eslon (1952-2000) above the Argentine
      Debarnot, the Columbian Castro Rojas and seven Spanish players. Jaan had moved to
      Valencia in the previous year
      and participated in local tournaments. Nine rounds were played from 30 xi
      until 8 xii <b>1978</b>. I have analysed one Eslon game.&nbsp;</font></p>

      <p align="justify">The change from a master event to a small grandmaster
      tournament took place in&nbsp; Linares<b> 1979.</b> Twelve participants played from 30 xi until
      12 xii. The victor of the previous year, Eslon, became fifth at 2½ points
      of the new winner Larry Christiansen. Star player of the event was Viktor
      Kortschnoj, runner-up of the world championship. Although he defeated
      Christiansen, he did not triumph in the contest. Two games by Christiansen
      have been analysed.&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="word-spacing: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">The
    grocery stores’ tycoon Luis Rentero Suárez contracted world champion
    Karpov and the grandmasters Larsen, Kavalek, Ljubojevic and Gligoric in
    Bugojno 1980 for the third contest. He was able to realise his ideal of a
    strong grandmaster tournament. Twelve grandmasters played in Linares from 17
    - 31 i <b>1981</b>.&nbsp;The tempo of 40 moves in 2½ hours followed by 16 in 1
    hour was applied, if Karpov participated in the 1980's.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="word-spacing: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Christiansen
      played the best tournament of his life. Eventually Karpov won due to a
      better Sonneborn-Berger score. Later the number of won games would become
      the criterion for shared leads. Ljubojevic stayed in Linares and married a
      local beauty, like Hannibal once did with Princess Imilce. Ljubo prepared
      the next event.&nbsp;</font></p>

      miracle of snowfall had occurred in Andalusia before the tournament
      started and Hotel Cervantes had no heating. So the playing hall and rooms
      were cold. The fourth <i>'Torneo Internacional
      Ciudad de Linares’ </i>took place from 11 until 25 ii <b>1983</b>.
      Christiansen had not been invited. Ljubojevic withdrew because Geller participated instead of Tal. The wins
      by the top three have been analysed.</font></p>
    <font FACE="Arial">
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">Spassky played a
    very economic tournament and won $6000. He scored three wins and seven short draws. Karpov
    and Andersson nearly had the same result.&nbsp;Boris started the tournament with
    his usual ‘end of the winter’ influenza and infected other players. Tolya hated him for it. Soon
    Spassky lost his Soviet stipend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    strong players participated in Linares from 8 - 22 iii <b>1985</b>. Karpov
    could not partake due to the exhausting aborted match against Kasparov.
    Adorjan took his place. The Soviets sent Makarychev as replacement, but he
    was refused. Hübner did not trust the playing conditions, stayed in the
    nearby Ubeda and arrived each round by taxi with warm clothes, Timman
    reported. Ljubojevic and Hübner competed for the first place.&nbsp;Ljubo
    won due to a better Sonneborn-Berger score. Eslon wrote the bulletin. He
    castigated short draws. His idea of value for money appealed to Rentero.</font></p>

    tournament occurred in 1986. The final of the candidates’ tournament
    between Karpov and Sokolov was played in Linares during the next year. <i>Ciudad
    de Linares</i> number six took place from 23 ii until 7 iii <b>1988</b>.
    The participants stayed and played in the new Hotel Anibal, a comfortable
    place with central heating. Rentero bought the hotel later. The sale of his
    stores had made him rich. Karpov did not partake, but his favourite time
    control of 40 moves in 2½ hours was applied and Baturinsky functioned as
    chief arbiter. Women's world champion Chiburdanidze replaced Tolya. Poor
    Maia started with ½/7 and cried each night, the story goes. Jan Timman
    played his adventurous chess. This time it led to an overwhelming victory. Media
    followed the tournament with great interest. The Spaniard Illescas scored a
    grandmaster norm in the last round. Rentero decided to organise the event
    annually.&nbsp;</font></p>

      from the Soviet union could be invited personally for the first time in <b>1989</b>.
      As a result, five instead of two Soviet grandmasters were invited and the
      average rating rose. Illescas’ invitation was cancelled for a further
      increase of the rating. The hated apparatchik Baturinsky became chief
      arbiter. This meant an affront for the refugees Kortschnoj and Gulko. It
      led to a showdown on the day of the first round. When the ‘red colonel’
      stayed in place, Kortschnoj left Linares.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">The
    tournament became a race between Ivanchuk and Karpov from 18 ii until 5 iii.

      the Soviet union was falling apart and would dissolve in 1991, its
      influence remained. Eight participants had a Soviet background in <b>1990</b>.
      World champion Kasparov entered for the first time. His preparation was
      poor, because he had to help his family in their flight from Baku. He
      wanted to conquer Karpov territory and cash the appearance fee of $30,000.
      Gary won and would win the event many times.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Spassky
    was allowed to participate if he did not play short draws. The agony lasted
    from 18 ii until 3 iii. An exhausted Boris begged Luis to lift the
    obligation. The ban on short draws became a general policy during the next
    years.&nbsp;</font></p>

      Time controls were made at the moves forty and sixty before the
      adjournment. Luis
      Rentero had increased the number of participants to fourteen. Eight players were top ten and six were top
      fifty. The event became a race between the technician Kasparov and mad
      genius Ivanchuk. This competition was very similar to the contest of
      Capablanca and Rubinstein in San Sebastian 1911.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <font FACE="Arial">
    <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">Ivanchuk
    won the race of Kasparov. Their technical ability after the opening was
    similar to the level of Rubinstein and Capablanca. Like Rubinstein, Ivanchuk
    was mentally too unstable for the world championship quest. Rentero had a
    great success as the organiser, because the best players in the world
    participated, and only 42% of the games were drawn. Players got a bonus of
    $2000 if they played an average of at least forty moves per game. Beliavsky
    got an extra prize because he drew the least.&nbsp;</p>

    tournament (22 ii - 14 iii <b>1992</b>). All top ten players took part. The
    tournament had become the Wimbledon of chess. Kasparov won with two points before the rest. Timman played scintillating
    chess. We follow their games.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">World champion
    Kasparov&nbsp; defeated all candidates for the world championship: Timman,
    Karpov, Jussupow and Short. Timman showed a great fighting spirit. He played
    a long endgame of two bishops versus knight against Speelman and won the

  players was highly impressive in the eleventh Linares <b> </b>
  tournament (22 ii until 15 iii <b>1993</b>), although Short refused to participate in
  the 'Russian championship'. It would become another race between Kasparov and
  Karpov. Howevever, their games of the first round had to be postponed due to
  flu. They began a fast race after the slow start. Kasparov defeated Karpov
  brilliantly in round ten and won the tournament eventually. Kramnik made a
  fine debut. Only 42% of the
  games ended in a draw. Still Rentero was upset after a few short draws but he
  calmed down by Timman's diplomacy.&nbsp;</font></p>
